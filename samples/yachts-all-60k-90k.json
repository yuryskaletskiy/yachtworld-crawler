Her fin keel with bulb has a low center of gravity which allows her to sail efficiently on all points of sail while providing excellent stability. The large diameter, leather sheathed wheel, coupled to a counter-balanced rudder, provides precise and easy steerage under sail or when maneuvering under power in tight quarters.   Application of Beneteau's patented Watershield System in the hull laminate provides protection against osmotic blistering. And by using a structural grid system in the hull, stiffness is ensured as well as correct rig and keel load distribution.   In the interior, open spaces, fixed hull ports and skylights, many opening ports and hatches, provide an abundance of light and air. The galley is close at hand both to the cockpit and the salon so the chef is never far from the rest of the crew.   The Oceanis 400 cockpit is a mastery of ergonomic design, giving plenty of elbow room to the largest of crews, whether underway or socializing around the cockpit table at the end of the day. High coamings provide plenty of back support and security for the crew.  Genoa tracks and turning blocks are placed on the cabin top as is the mainsheet traveller. This positioning improves the sheeting angle of the genoa and enhances upwind performance. It also clears the side decks making them safer to use.  The double spreader, furling mast has discontinuous rigging and forward lower shrouds. The furling mainsail is controlled by an inhaul and an outhaul line led aft to the maneuvering winch. All lines running aft from the mast to the cockpit are covered by a deck cowling.  Genoa sheets and maneuvering lines are controlled by large self-tailing winches, and are used standing rather than sitting, making it easier for the crew. Rope tails are stored using tiebacks affixed to the coachroof. Lifeline gates are at maximum beam where they are most accessible.  The anchor locker contains the standard manual anchor windlass and the below deck furling drum. The stemhead has two anchor rollers, one of which tilts and is balanced forward to allow easier lowering of the anchor.   There is a single and double aft cabin version.": "", "Number of cabins": "3", "Autopilot": "", "Bimini Top": "", "Holding Tanks": "(100 Liters)", "LWL": "10.64 m", "Cockpit shower": "", "Hull Shape": "Monohull", "Battery charger": "", "VHF": "", "Depthsounder": "", "Ballast": "2404 kgs", "Number of bathrooms": "2", "Oceanis 400 Specifications -

Her powerful rig, swept back spreaders, and large mainsail enhance her performance, while the bulb-wing keel keeps her stable and shallow in draft. Special touches like a small furling headsail, single-line reefing, and sail flaking, make cruising the 40.5 so enjoyable.  A wide-open cockpit, complete with table keep you comfortable in a seaway or on the hook. Down below, there is an incredible salon finished in rich fabrics, hand-rubbed teak and Corian counters. The L-shaped galley is truly workable including a dual-opening refrigerator and freezer, stove with oven, and even a dish rack complete with dishes. Accommodations are sumptuous and can handle a crew of six and even eight with the optional tri-cabin version.

Structurally, only the best possible performance features have been adopted": "injected carbon - vinylester rudder blade; composite rudder stock (with self-aligning upper and lower rudder bearings); and glassed inner structure for rigidity, weight saving, and optimal distribution of stresses from the rigging, keel, and helm.  The large wheel is leather covered. The helmsman's seat is slatted teak. The genoa has an efficient sheeting angle of 10 degrees and comes equipped with Lewmar racing ball bearing cars (the mainsail car is the same). The sidedecks are wide and almost level with extremely efficient nonskid, handrails are always within arms reach, and the foredeck is completely uncluttered.  The nav station has an expansive chart table and plenty of shelves and lockers - fine craftsmanship is evident throughout. The electronics panel is slightly curved for maximum instrument viewing. Behind the curved navigator's seat lies a storage shelf perfect for charts, binoculars, and gear. To port, the L-shaped galley is ideal for cooking whether underway or at an anchorage. Galley equipment includes a stainless steel double sink with pressurized hot and cold water, a large 12V refrigerator, gimbaled stove, and plenty of space for storage.   The salon is comfortable and is enhanced by plenty of light and ventilation. The settees invite the entire crew to relax, comfortably seating six around the inlaid table. The curved lockers and shelves behind the settees are not only elegant but thoroughly functional. The head is to starboard and forward of the salon. It is fully lined and fitted with a marine toilet, wash basin with shower unit, a hanging locker, and plenty of room for storage.  Perfect for offshore racing or extended voyages, the First 40.7 has three sleeping cabins, all with hanging lockers and plenty of shelves. The forward cabin has a private entrance to the head and is ventilated with a large overhead hatch.

It has an efficient layout, ergonomic cockpit, and impressive sail plan. For those who would rather cruise, the optional removable cockpit lockers, easy to handle furling genoa, fully battened mainsail, and moderate draft, all make the First 40.7 an extremely versatile boat. Structurally, only the best possible performance features have been adopted": "injected carbon - vinylester rudder blade; composite rudder stock (with self-aligning upper and lower rudder bearings); and glassed inner structure for rigidity, weight saving, and optimal distribution of stresses from the rigging, keel, and helm.  The large wheel is leather covered. The helmsman's seat is slatted teak. The genoa has an efficient sheeting angle of 10 degrees and comes equipped with Lewmar racing ball bearing cars (the mainsail car is the same). The sidedecks are wide and almost level with extremely efficient nonskid, handrails are always within arms reach, and the foredeck is completely uncluttered.  The nav station has an expansive chart table and plenty of shelves and lockers - fine craftsmanship is evident throughout. The electronics panel is slightly curved for maximum instrument viewing. Behind the curved navigator's seat lies a storage shelf perfect for charts, binoculars, and gear. To port, the L-shaped galley is ideal for cooking whether underway or at an anchorage. Galley equipment includes a stainless steel double sink with pressurized hot and cold water, a large 12V refrigerator, gimbaled stove, and plenty of space for storage.   The salon is comfortable and is enhanced by plenty of light and ventilation. The settees invite the entire crew to relax, comfortably seating six around the inlaid table. The curved lockers and shelves behind the settees are not only elegant but thoroughly functional. The head is to starboard and forward of the salon. It is fully lined and fitted with a marine toilet, wash basin with shower unit, a hanging locker, and plenty of room for storage.  Perfect for offshore racing or extended voyages, the First 40.7 has three sleeping cabins, all with hanging lockers and plenty of shelves. The forward cabin has a private entrance to the head and is ventilated with a large overhead hatch. The two aft cabins also have plenty of ventilation and large berths that are produced in two parts so that leeboards can be installed.", "Convertible Saloon": "", "The Company offers the details of this vessel in good faith but cannot guarantee or warrant the accuracy of this information nor warrant the condition of the vessel.

The Sun Odyssey 40 represents quality, innovation, and fun - the fun of hanging out in a spacious cockpit with its unique twin-wheel steering stations (not found on other 39-foot boats), the fun of moving about on a wide deck design, and the fun of a cozy interior (in a 2 or 3 cabin layout).  The cockpit width that extends all the way to the stern is exceptional. With lots of room for the crew, nobody is in the way. With twin steering wheels, ergonomic cockpit benches, plenty of storage space for all cruising gear, a folding cockpit table, and an accessible mainsail traveler on the roof, the Sun Odyssey 40 has the space and comfort desired for easy sailing. The waterdrop-shaped stern has built-in steps and a shower, making it easy to jump in for a swim. With such shallow drafts, it's easy to approach protected anchorages. Equipped with a standard genoa furler and a semi-full batten mainsail (furling mast optional), it is a simple boat to maneuver under all weather conditions. The shrouds are located inboard, opening up the passageways for safe and sure movements on deck. The stylish windows and quality hardware show the best that the Sun Odyssey 40 has to offer.  The Sun Odyssey 40 comes with several different layouts where the priority is on maximum comfort. The spacious salon is finished with the traditional Jeanneau attention to detail, and the feeling below is that of warmth and relaxation. Other features of the Sun Odyssey 40 are": "a solid teak table, wide bench seats, captain's area to port with nav station table, a complete galley, and numerous storage lockers. The head compartment, along with the standard amenities, also has a separate shower zone.

The Sun Odyssey 40 represents quality, innovation, and fun - the fun of hanging out in a spacious cockpit with its unique twin-wheel steering stations (not found on other 39-foot boats), the fun of moving about on a wide deck design, and the fun of a cozy interior (in a 2 or 3 cabin layout).  The cockpit width that extends all the way to the stern is exceptional. With lots of room for the crew, nobody is in the way. With twin steering wheels, ergonomic cockpit benches, plenty of storage space for all cruising gear, a folding cockpit table, and an accessible mainsail traveler on the roof, the Sun Odyssey 40 has the space and comfort desired for easy sailing. The waterdrop-shaped stern has built-in steps and a shower, making it easy to jump in for a swim. With such shallow drafts, it's easy to approach protected anchorages. Equipped with a standard genoa furler and a semi-full batten mainsail (furling mast optional), it is a simple boat to maneuver under all weather conditions. The shrouds are located inboard, opening up the passageways for safe and sure movements on deck. The stylish windows and quality hardware show the best that the Sun Odyssey 40 has to offer.  The Sun Odyssey 40 comes with several different layouts where the priority is on maximum comfort. The spacious salon is finished with the traditional Jeanneau attention to detail, and the feeling below is that of warmth and relaxation.

The head is of equal size with the head in the aft stateroom and is complete with hot and cold pressure water. The main salon has a drop-leaf dinette and two settees that convert into berths. A nav station is starboard and has an entrance into the aft head. A cook's delight, the galley features a double stainless steel sink, and hot and cold pressure water. Cooking is easy on the three-burner LPG gimbaled stove and oven. During extended cruising, food will stay fresh and cold in two iceboxes that have a combined capacity of 9.5 cubic feet. The spacious aft cabin has a double berth, a large cedar-trimmed hanging locker, nine drawers, and five storage lockers. The walk-through head has teak privacy doors, pressure hot water shower, large teak-framed mirror, counter cabinet, and storage locker. Keeping the accommodations bright and airy are nine opening ports, seven fixed ports, and six tinted opening ventilation hatches. \n \nRigged as a sloop, the Irwin 38 carries more sail than most standard cruisers giving her greater cruising speed while allowing her to move easily in light summer breezes. The rig is easily handled by two and has internal halyards, outhauls, two-speed genoa winches, a main sheet winch, and an adjustable topping lift. The large center cockpit provides excellent visibility and easy handling. The destroyer wheel is mounted on the steering pedestal with all engine controls and a compass.

Only material that stands up to discerning selection is actually put into use.  Inviting and comfortable, the saloon conveys safeness and well-being. This atmosphere can only be conveyed by a handcrafted, high-grade interior design of precious woods. Staying on the Bavaria 37 means pure fun. Terrific solutions in detail and superior functionality are the convincing asset of the Bavaria 37 - proof of the builders' skills and the designers' and constructors' commitment to yachting.  The construction at crucial points is beyond the regulations by Lloyds. This increases safety at sea, increases the stability of value and makes living on board more comfortable.  Sandwich laminate technology such as that used in the aircraft industry and on ice-breaking boats is used in the above-water hull and in the deck. The sandwich layer is of water-repellent closed-cell foam to increase the dent-resistance of the shell. Its low heat conductivity prevents condensation and makes the interior climate more pleasant.  Kevlar fabric, the material of which bullet-proof jackets are made, is worked into the forebody below the waterline to protect against collision. The doubled laminate thickness of the keel flange triples the safety factor in case of impact. The floor timber is reinforced by stiff S-glass layers.

She is designed in a classic timeless style, with lines that promise an outstanding speed potential. The suitability of each fitting, even of minor equipment, is thoroughly tested by Bavaria. Only material that stands up to discerning selection is actually put into use.  Inviting and comfortable, the saloon conveys safeness and well-being. This atmosphere can only be conveyed by a handcrafted, high-grade interior design of precious woods. Staying on the Bavaria 37 means pure fun. Terrific solutions in detail and superior functionality are the convincing asset of the Bavaria 37 - proof of the builders' skills and the designers' and constructors' commitment to yachting.  The construction at crucial points is beyond the regulations by Lloyds. This increases safety at sea, increases the stability of value and makes living on board more comfortable.  Sandwich laminate technology such as that used in the aircraft industry and on ice-breaking boats is used in the above-water hull and in the deck. The sandwich layer is of water-repellent closed-cell foam to increase the dent-resistance of the shell. Its low heat conductivity prevents condensation and makes the interior climate more pleasant.  Kevlar fabric, the material of which bullet-proof jackets are made, is worked into the forebody below the waterline to protect against collision. The doubled laminate thickness of the keel flange triples the safety factor in case of impact. The floor timber is reinforced by stiff S-glass layers.

She is designed in a classic timeless style, with lines that promise an outstanding speed potential. The suitability of each fitting, even of minor equipment, is thoroughly tested by Bavaria. Only material that stands up to discerning selection is actually put into use.   \n   \nInviting and comfortable, the saloon conveys safeness and well-being. This atmosphere can only be conveyed by a handcrafted, high-grade interior design of precious woods. Staying on the Bavaria 37 means pure fun. Terrific solutions in detail and superior functionality are the convincing asset of the Bavaria 37 - proof of the builders' skills and the designers' and constructors' commitment to yachting.   \n   \nThe construction at crucial points is beyond the regulations by Lloyds. This increases safety at sea, increases the stability of value and makes living on board more comfortable.   \n   \nSandwich laminate technology such as that used in the aircraft industry and on ice-breaking boats is used in the above-water hull and in the deck. The sandwich layer is of water-repellent closed-cell foam to increase the dent-resistance of the shell. Its low heat conductivity prevents condensation and makes the interior climate more pleasant.   \n   \nKevlar fabric, the material of which bullet-proof jackets are made, is worked into the forebody below the waterline to protect against collision. The doubled laminate thickness of the keel flange triples the safety factor in case of impact. The floor timber is reinforced by stiff S-glass layers.

The installation of a tiller is lighter, around 10 kilograms saved over the wheel system of the IMX. However, unlike IOR, where every ounce saved in the aft of the yacht allows the stern to lift, shortening the waterline and thus saving valuable rating points, the IMS rule measures the whole hull and such incremental gains are lost.  The choice of rig for the IMX 38 was a modern three-spreader mast head rig which has a relatively large mainsail and smaller headsails than the traditional mast head configuration.  The mast section, developed specially for the IMX 38, is strong enough to be able to withstand mishandling from a less experienced crew, yet light and flexible enough to satisfy the most experienced racing sailor.

For the interior design of the X-362, modern woodworking production tools are used for the best possible finish. The finest teak veneers are hand-selected. Laminated, flush-mounted hand rails are used for their great strength and security.  X-Yachts design team has invested thousands of hours to develop modern production techniques and tooling methods in order to make possible the creation of such a yacht as the X-362. For example, the complex and highly finished GRP interior head liner (with integral halogen spotlights) not only satisfies the designer's demand for an elegant and attractive finish, its durability also adds to the lifetime of the yacht. The gently rounded deck surfaces not only please the eye but undoubtedly add to the safety and comfort of the yacht.  All of the features of the X-362 combine to create a yacht with high stability relative to displacement and size, a yacht which can carry more sail, with excellent weight concentration (light ends, especially the bow) which results in an easier, softer motion through waves.   Other key elements include the use of sandwich construction, tapered aluminum rudder stocks, roller bearings for the rudder strap, a steering system with finger tip feel, masts which are extra stiff and strong, discontinuous rod rigging, steel bottom girder for rig and keel loads, as well as extensive use of composite interior bulkheads and careful positioning of heavy items such as the engine, tanks, and batteries.   There is a composite iron - lead bulb keel for maximum stability and a galvanized steel floor frame for ultimate strength. On deck the large diameter leather covered wheel and low friction needle bearings for the rudder shaft combined with a very direct transmission make the X-362 a joy to steer.", "Shore power inlet": "", "Total Power": "27 HP", "Beam": "3.48 m", "Steering wheel": "", "Maximum Draft": "1.90 m", "Dry Weight": "5189 kgs", "Log-speedometer": "", "Refrigerator": "", "Storm jib": "", "Gennaker/Cruising spinnaker": "", "Headroom": "1.85 m", "Plotter": "", "Builder": "X-Yachts", "Compass": "", "Swimming ladder": "", "Engine 1": "", "Fully battened mainsail": "", "Wind speed and direction": "", "Keel": "Fin", "Fuel Tanks": "(80 Liters)", "Hot water": "", "Genoa": "", "GPS": "", "Designer": "Niels Jeppesen", "Spinnaker": "", "Engine Type": "Inboard", "Displacement": "5189 kgs", "Engine Power": "27 HP", "Asymmetric spinnaker": "", "Oven": ""}, "located": "Athens, Greece", "year": "1996", "id": "74530-2445022"},
